# Hal Universal

**Private. Powerful. Personal.**

Hal Universal is an on-device AI assistant for macOS and iOS powered by Apple Foundation Models.  
All inference runs locally — no cloud calls, no analytics, and no data collection.

---

### 🧠 Overview

Hal Universal is a transparent, privacy-first AI companion built for Apple platforms.  
It combines Apple’s **Foundation Models** and **MLX Phi-3** with a fully local memory engine — offering conversational intelligence that stays entirely on your device.

### 🚀 How to Use

1. **Start a Chat**  
   Type any message in the chat bar. Hal responds instantly using your selected on-device model.

2. **Switch Models**  
   Tap the model selector to toggle between:  
   - 🧩 **Apple Foundation Model (AFM)** — balanced and contextually natural  
   - ⚙️ **Phi-3 (MLX)** — fast, efficient, and self-contained on your device

3. **Memory & Context**  
   Hal remembers the flow of conversation within your session.  
   Older turns are summarized and stored locally in a private SQLite database — never uploaded or synced.

4. **Settings**  
   Adjust memory depth, recall scope, and other tuning preferences directly within the app.

### 🧰 Troubleshooting & Maintenance

If you ever experience unexpected behavior or model loading issues, Hal Universal includes two simple maintenance tools:

#### 1. 🔄 Reset / “DB Nuke”
Clears Hal’s local SQLite database and resets all memory and chat history.  
This is a full local reset — no data is ever uploaded or synced.  
Downloaded models remain intact.

#### 2. 🧹 Model Removal & Redownload
If a model fails to load or perform as expected:
- Open **Settings → Manage Models**  
- Tap **Delete Phi-3** (or **Remove AFM Cache**) to clear local model files  
- Tap **Download** to redownload a fresh copy from Apple’s model repository  

These actions operate entirely on-device and never contact external servers except to download the Phi-3 model.
